# Object Oriented Programming using Java

## Unit 1

### Java Buzzword
1. Simple
    - easy to learn
    - no pointers, operator overloading, structures, unions  
2. Secure
    - doesn't have poniter
    - applet doesn't allow access to other parts of computer
3. Portable
    - run on multiple OS, cpu's
4. Object-oriented
5. Robust
    - strong memory managment mechanism (garbage collection)
    - error handling
6. Architecture-neutral (or) Platform Independent
7. Multi-threaded
8. Interpreted
    - The byte code is interpreted to any machine code so that it runs on the native machine
9. High performance
    - simplicity, JVM, interpretation
10. Distributed
    - support TCP/IP protocols
11. Dynamic
    - dynamically allocate, deallocate memory
    - bytecode can be dynamically updated

### step by step execution of java code
1. java code
2. compiler
3. bytecode
4. JVM
5. machine code

### bytecode and advantages
1. defination: intermidiate machine code
2. pros: cross-platform, save time, runs on JVM only
3. cons: 
    * difficult to use platform specific features
    * mandatory to have JVM
    * more time to run bytecode than machine code



### Overview of Java Language
* pros:
    1. portable, cross platform, write once use anywhere
    2. secure from viruses and tampering
    3. multithread programming is supported
    4. robust - manages memory for you, automatic garbage collection
    5. interpreted and object oriented

* java compiler converts .java to .class (bytecode) by using `javac` command, bytecode is understood by the java virtual machine
* same bytecode can run on any device with any OS that has jvm
* java platform has 2 components:
    1. java virtual machine
    2. java API
* types:
    1. application program: for local computer
    2. applet program: for internet application
